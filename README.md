# Double Diamond SVG Generator

I have come to use in my professional life the Design Council's Double Diamond model (https://www.designcouncil.org.uk/our-resources/the-double-diamond/) numerous times. The challenge that I faced was that for every presentation I wanted a visual that was different than the ones I found online. 

For this reason I created this application.

This project provides a **JS+HTML+CSS and a Python application with a Tkinter user interface** for generating parameterized SVG diagrams of the **Design Council’s Double Diamond model**.  
Users can customize visual aspects through the UI and export different variants of the diagram as an SVG file.
